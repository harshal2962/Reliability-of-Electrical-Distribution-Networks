# Reliability-of-Electrical-Distribution-Networks
Evaluating and optimizing reliability indices for a radial distribution system using continuous particle swarm optimization.

In distribution system, Reliability is defined as the ability to deliver an uninterrupted service
to the customer. To calculate reliability indices like energy not supplied, supply average
interrupted frequency index, supply average interrupted duration index, customer average
interrupted duration index in any radial distribution system, first different paths(existing radial networks) for this system are found
using cut set method in MATLAB.
Here, basic load point indices are failure rate and average outage time which is optimized by
Particle Swarm optimization method, using constraints which minimizes the failure
rate and outage time in order to expand or to invest in the 8 bus distribution system.
